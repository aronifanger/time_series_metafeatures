    "1. Length of the time series (LEN): number of observations of the series.\n",
    "2. Mean of the absolute values of the 5 first autocorrelations (MEAN-COR): high values of this feature suggests that the value of the series at a time point is very dependent of the values in recent past points.\n",
    "3. Test of significant autocorrelations (TAC): presence of at least one significant autocorrelation taking into account the first 5.\n",
    "4. Significance of the first, second and third autocorrelation (TAC1, TAC2 and TAC3): indicates significant dependences in more recent past points.\n",
    "5. Coeficient of variation (COEF-VAR): measures the degree of instability in the series.\n",
    "6. Absolute value of the skewness and kurtosis coeficient (KURT and SKEW): measure the degree of non-normality in the series.\n",
    "7. Test of Turning Points for randomness (TURN): A point $Z_t$ is a turning point of a series if $Z_{t‚àí1} < Z_t > Z_{t+1}$, or $Z_{t‚àí1} > Z_t < Z_{t+1}$. The presence of a very large or a very low number of turning points in a series suggests that the series is not generated by a purely random process.\n",
